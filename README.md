# Summary
Randomizer for Mario Kart 8 on the Nintendo Wii U. 

# Description
  <p>
    This application is a totally unauthorized add-on for the very popular Mario Kart 8 by Nintendo for the Wii U&trade;.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app came about because my family plays Mario Kart for hours at a time. After a while, we discovered that each of us tended
    to favor the same character and kart combination.
  </p>
  <p>
    We started by throwing dice for each player, kart, tire, and glider combination. It took a while, and it's hard to find 18-sided
    dice. We had to come up with something a little simpler.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have taken great care not to use any proprietary assets. Everything, to our knowledge, is fan created. While we believe
    we have not infringed on any copyrights or violated any trademarks, there is always the potential that Nintendo could
    come in an shut this app down.
